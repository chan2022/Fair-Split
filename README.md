# 🤝 Fair-Split

Fair-Split is a tool designed to make splitting expenses between friends truly fair, especially in countries where tax and tip are calculated after the subtotal. Whether you're sharing dinner, groceries, or event costs, Fair-Split helps break down exactly who owes what. Down to the item and tax level. <br><br>


💡 Why Fair-Split? <br><br>
Example Scenario: <br>

    friend "A" orders 1 item, friend "B" orders 3 and friend "C" orders 2.<br>
    You try to split the bill equally, and someone gets overcharged.<br>
    Tax and tip are added at the end, and no one knows how to fairly divide them 🤷‍♀️<br>

Fair-Split handles all of that. It ensures that everyone pays their fair share! Not a cent more, not a cent less. <br><br>


🧮 How It Works (Planned)
  - 🧾 Itemized Input : Enter each item and who paid for what

  - 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Custom Group Splits : Assign items to people (can split one item between multiple people)

  - 💸 Tax & Tip Allocation : Automatically calculates fair tax/tip split based on each person’s share

  - 📱 Cross-platform : Web-based with mobile-friendly design

  - 🔁 Repayment Summary : Tells you who owes who and how much
